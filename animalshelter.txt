This is my exploratory analysis of the Animal Shelter data set on Kaggle. The first steps is to see what type of data I am working with.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
```


```{r}
train_dt <- data.table(read.csv("train.csv"))
head(train_dt)
```

The first things I notice is that the outcome type can be logically determined by AnimaType, SexuponOutcome, AeuponOutcome, Breed, and Color. So now I am curious to see what the range of outcomes are for these fields.

```{r}
sapply(train_dt,class)
unique(train_dt$AnimalType)
unique(train_dt$SexuponOutcome)
unique(train_dt$Breed)
unique(train_dt$AgeuponOutcome)
```

Now we have a good understanding of the data present.My next step is to implement a decision tree since its the easeist and most visually represented of the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(rpart)
fit <- rpart(OutcomeType ~ AnimalType + SexuponOutcome + AgeuponOutcome + Breed + Color, data = train_dt)
```
